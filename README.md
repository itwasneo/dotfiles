## About **dotfiles** script

I'm trying to convert my entire development setup from bash scripts to ansible progressively. This file serves as a
starting point for the further automation with ansible playbooks. If you want to learn about the details checkout:

## üìú About .sh files

I'm configuring and keeping my setups updated through .sh files.

### dot.sh

This is for updating and setting up the local configuration files of following programs:

- zsh
- tmux
- NeoVim

## üóî About NeoVim

Although I'm still a dummy when it comes to **vim**, I configured this setup by myself. It is **very very simplistic** and serves
enough features. It is entirely lua based.There are couple of links that I want to share which also influenced
this configuration:

## ü™ü About tmux with NeoVim conflict

I don't know why, but I spent too much time to support RGB colors in NeoVim inside a tmux session. Following line that
should reside in your `.tmux.conf` file was the answer for me.

```
set-option -s terminal-features ",*256col*:RGB"
```
